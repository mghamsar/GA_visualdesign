Creative Brief: What are we designing, who are we designing for? Who is the audience? 

Primary and Secondary meaning. 

5 adjectives to describe the brand ---> what am I trying to get across?? 


Visual Design Purposes: 1. Emotion, 2. Description, 3. Structure, 4. Communication (communicate without saying a word)

The logo alone can set the stage for a feeling about the brand. 

Putting your thoughts on paper is very important. The first design is usually not the chosen one. 

Emotion: Heart in Airbnb announcements

Structure: Airbnb example: Search is prominent, there is a primary draw for the page. 
		   The how-to process is generally simplified with visual design, including a step that includes an image and text. 


Basic Elements: Layout, Graphics, Text, Color

Layout: Contrast: weight, size, typography, hierarchy
        Alignment: 101 to get down, separates clean design from non-good one. 
        Repetition: using similar patterns throughout the design, consistency, makes things feel unified
        Proximity: things that are related are close together, things that are different are farther away


The Grid: Really useful for alignment. 
          Dribble -> to get a grid
          CSS -> 960 grid system
